# Games
Action games focus on physical challenges, including hand-eye coordination and reaction-time. These games are fast-paced and often require quick thinking and reflexes. Examples include platformers, beat 'em ups, and shooter games.
Adventure games are story-driven games that emphasize exploration, puzzle-solving, and interaction with in-game characters or environments. These games often feature rich narratives and immersive worlds.
Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. One player uses the symbol "X", and the other uses "O". The objective is to be the first to align three of the same symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on the grid. The game ends when one player wins, or all spaces are filled, resulting in a draw.
The Snake Game is an arcade game in which the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food that appears randomly. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The objective is to make the snake as long as possible without colliding into walls or the snakeâ€™s own body. The game ends when the snake crashes into itself or the wall.
Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle that is played on a 9x9 grid, which is divided into 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill in the grid so that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition. Some numbers are provided at the start (called "givens"), and the player must logically deduce the correct placement for the remaining numbers.
